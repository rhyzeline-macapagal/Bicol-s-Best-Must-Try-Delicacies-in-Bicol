                <div class="desc">The <b>Bicol Express</b> is arguably the most famous and iconic dish from the region. 
                    It was named after the passenger train from Manila to Bicol and is also called “sinilihan.” 
                    It is one of the most popular regional dishes in the Phillipines, best known for its sspicyness. 
                    Its original Bicolano recipe uses long chilies of siling haba, coconut milk or gata, and pork as 
                    ingredients. Through the years, several versions of the Bicol Express have been made in order to 
                    cater to foodies who are not a  fan of spicy food. There is also porkless version for vegetarian 
                    foodies. You can find this anywhere in the Philippines, but nothing beats the taste of Bicol 
                    expresses cooked in Albay.<br></div>

                    This homegrown noodle recipe from Naga is something you should not miss when you 
                    are in Bicol. Visually, it is comparable to beef mami, a dish most Filipinos are familiar with.

                  <div class="desc">Commonly known as Laing, <b>Pinangat</b> na Gabi is a creamy and spicy dish that makes use of coconut milk, a prominent ingredient in Bicolano cuisine.
                    The dish is made with laing or taro leaves, coconut cream, siling labuyo, lemongrass, garlic, and shrimp paste. One can also add meat to make it more 
                    enticing for non-vegetarians.As its name suggests, gabi leaves serve as its other main ingredient and are joined by meat, ginger, garlic and chili.
                     The best pinangat is in Camalig, Albay, and it is freshly served, either hot or frozen. Your Albay getaway won’t complete if you don’t buy frozen pinangat 
                     because this is usually one of the treats visitors would bring home.<br>

                    <div class="desc">Bicol also has a delectable seafood dish aptly called Kinunot, which literally means “to tear apart” in Bicolano. 
                      It is usually made with flaked fish, specifically shark or stingray meat. But ever since, the government prohibited the catching 
                      and selling of endangered marine life such as whale, shark, and manta rays, the Bicolanos have used other seafood such as the tilapia. 
                      The Kinunot is often enjoyed as an appetizer, but it can very well pass as a main dish.<br></div>
