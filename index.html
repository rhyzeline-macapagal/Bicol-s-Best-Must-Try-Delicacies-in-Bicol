                  <p class="title">Viand</p>
                  <p>The Bicol Express is arguably the most famous and iconic dish from the region. It was named after the passenger train from Manila to Bicol and is also called “sinilihan.” It’s one of the most popular regional dishes in the Phillipines, best known for its sspicyness. It’’s original Bicolano recipe uses long chilies of siling haba, coconut milk or gata, and pork as ingredients. Through the years, several versions of the Bicol Express have been made in order to cater to foodies who aren’t a  fan of spicy food. There’s also porkless version for vegetarian foodies. You can find this anywhere in the Philippines, but nothing beats the taste of Bicol expresses cooked in Albay.  .</p>

                  <p class="title">Merienda</p>
                  <p> This homegrown noodle recipe from Naga is something you shouldn’t miss when you’re in Bicol. Visually, it’s comparable to beef mami, a dish most Filipinos are familiar with. But what makes Kinalas different is the addition of a thick and dark brown sauce on top of the noodles, which is often likened to a pancit palabok sauce. 
                    The mixture of firm noodles, hearty broth, and a garnish of scraped meat from a cow’s or pig’s heart makes Kinalas one of the Nagueño’s best comfort foods.

                  <p>Bicol also has a delectable seafood dish aptly called Kinunot, which literally means “to tear apart” in Bicolano. It is usually made with flaked fish, specifically shark or stingray meat. But ever since, the government prohibited the catching and selling of endangered marine life such as whale, shark, and manta rays, the Bicolanos have used other seafood such as the tilapia. The Kinunot is often enjoyed as an appetizer, but it can very well pass as a main dish.</p>

                    </p>

                <p>I was actually confused when i first heard the term they used for this product. They’re calling it Santan and theyt first thing that strikes my mind is the tiny breed of flowers. Santan is basically another pili delicacy. It is a coco jam mixed with pili nuts. I don’t know if Santan is a Bicolano term but regardless of it, this sweet delicacy is ideal spread for bread.</p>

This grated cassava is filled with bukayo or coconut strips sweetened in caramelized brown sugar made from sugarcane. Unang kalog or Inot na kalog as locally said is the best coconut to use in making bukayo for this kakanin. It is wrapped in banana leaves forming a rectangular shape before steaming. It has a great chemistry with kape during snack time or merindalan.</p>

                <p>A kind of puto native to Bicol and Quezon. Its purple color confuses people to think it’s made with ube but it’s actually just food coloring! Its regular color is white because it’s made from glutinous rice. The puto itself is delicious and fluffy, and only takes seconds to cook in the makeshift steamer that the street vendors use. Once you bite in, you’ll be surprised by the sweet coconut filling inside that makes the dish such a treat.</p>

                <p>One Bicolano specialty that you should try is the toasted siopao. It’s not the same steamed siopao that we used to know but its like a “monay bread” stuffed with pork asado and boiled egg. It is actually not fried but baked until well done thus, “toasted”. Its asado filling is saucy and very flavorful. You don’t need to put siopao sauce when eating toasted siopao. The bun also tastes good and its nicely toasted yet soft in the inside.</p>
